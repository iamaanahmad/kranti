# API Conventions

API routes are a security boundary.

Every mutation must authenticate when required, authorize the resource/action, validate input, enforce size/rate limits, return safe errors, and avoid leaking implementation details.

Public responses contain only intentionally public fields. Do not return raw Appwrite exceptions, stack traces, secrets or private fields.

Prefer idempotent mutations where retries are possible. External side effects must record enough state to prevent accidental duplicates.

Issue support and petition signing return `notificationSaved`: `true` when the creator alert was saved, `false` when its write failed, and `null` when no alert was attempted. A saved support or signature remains successful when its secondary alert fails.
Issue support returns a safe HTTP 503 JSON response when its result cannot be confirmed. Retrying the same support cannot create a second support record.
Alert read updates return safe HTTP 503 JSON when Appwrite cannot confirm the result. The dashboard reloads alerts before another try.

Issue creation accepts no evidence or a list of valid evidence metadata. Malformed evidence metadata returns HTTP 400 before file or issue writes.
Issue creation rejects JSON request bodies over 1 MiB with HTTP 413 before any Appwrite write.
Issue creation returns safe HTTP 503 when a save result cannot be confirmed. The citizen must check the dashboard before retrying.
Petition creation rejects JSON request bodies over 1 MiB with HTTP 413 before any Appwrite write.
Incident report creation rejects JSON request bodies over 1 MiB with HTTP 413 before evidence processing or Appwrite writes.
Moderator actions reject JSON request bodies over 1 MiB with HTTP 413 before issue or moderation-log writes.
Moderator actions return safe HTTP 503 JSON when a status update or its audit write cannot be confirmed. After an audit failure, refresh the issue and check its review record before trying again.
Issue comments reject JSON request bodies over 1 MiB with HTTP 413 before issue lookup or comment writes.
Campaign creation rejects JSON request bodies over 1 MiB with HTTP 413 before campaign lookups or writes.

Public lists require bounded pagination. Never expose an unbounded collection query.

Petition detail reads return safe HTTP 503 JSON when Appwrite is unavailable. The page offers retry.
Signed-in alert reads return up to 50 records by default, with `hasMore` and an `offset` from 0 to 10000 for older alerts. The existing `limit` option stays capped at 100.

The public petition list reads evidence only for petitions in its bounded result set.
The public petition list returns up to 25 petitions per request. Use an `offset` from 0 to 10000 and the `hasMore` flag to read older petitions.
At the offset cap, `hasMore` is false even when more records exist beyond the supported range.

The public issue list reads evidence and creator profiles only for issues in its bounded result set.
The public issue list returns up to 25 issues per request, newest first by Appwrite creation time. Use an `offset` from 0 to 10000 and the `hasMore` flag to read older issues.

An issue detail page reads only evidence and comments linked to that issue and the creator's profile. These reads are bounded.

The public issue-comment endpoint returns at most 100 approved comments per request. Use an `offset` from 0 to 10000 and the `hasMore` response flag to read later pages. Issue detail pages start with the first 100 approved comments and let readers load later pages.

The default public campaign list returns up to 25 campaigns per request. Use an `offset` from 0 to 10000 and the `hasMore` flag to read older campaigns. Existing visibility filters still apply. Explicit status queries keep their prior 100-result limit and do not accept a later offset while campaign review remains pending.

The signed-in dashboard reads only the citizen's own cases and cases they supported or signed. It pages through that citizen's participation records so older cases remain visible.
The dashboard response contains case lists only. The client reads its signed-in profile from Clerk; the case API does not return that profile.

New petition addresses contain a readable English title prefix when available, followed by the petition ID. Hindi-only titles use `petition` as the prefix. Existing addresses stay unchanged.

New issue addresses contain a readable English title prefix when available, followed by the issue ID. Hindi-only titles use `issue` as the prefix. Existing addresses stay unchanged.

Keep Appwrite credentials server-side and use least-privileged access.

Do not break existing clients/routes without a migration or compatibility strategy.
